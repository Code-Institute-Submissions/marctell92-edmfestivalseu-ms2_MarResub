#### Research

BOUNDLESS new concept doesn't have any direct competition on the web. It's concept is dense,
therefore the goal will be to introduce this new concept to the generic public by condensing the
information in a visible and descriptive way, to help users to get familiar with the concept in the first visit.
In the future, this website could develop in a B2B (Business-to-Business) concept. However, at first we will take a B2C (Business-to-Customer) approach,
focusing on the emotional triggers such as branding and the ease of readability.

Present the website on a user-friendly form, where information can be absorbed easily.
